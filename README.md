## About The Project

Pr0p0ll is a platform for [pr0gramm](https://pr0gramm.com) users to create and participate in polls. The maintainer of the old platform ([RundesBalli](https://github.com/RundesBalli)) has transferred the project to Tschucki. The new platform has been developed using Laravel and [Filament](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

To access the platform, the user must have an account on [pr0gramm](https://pr0gramm.com) to authenticate via O-Auth.

### Features

#### Poll Builder
Allows the user to create polls. The polls can be created with different question types.
#### Define Target Groups
The user can define who is allowed to participate in the poll. The poll can either be public or only available to specific user groups.
#### Poll Participation
The user can participate in polls. The user can see the results of the poll after the poll has ended.
#### Poll Results
See the results of the poll after the poll has ended and filter the results by demographic data.
